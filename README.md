# SUPER Circle Drone of Doom

This is my 2nd self-made synthesizer. This project is based on the [Circle Drone of Doom](https://www.lookmumnocomputer.com/projects#/circledroneofdoom) by LOOK MUM NO COMPUTER. And I added the following features to the circuit:
- an echo/reverb unit
- an interface to sync with other synths (Sync24/DIN Sync)

- I used an LM358 Signal Amplifier Module. I stumbled across it's existence while researching for another project (https://www.hackster.io/mircemk/diy-sensitive-arduino-ib-metal-detector-d5e029). This module seems to be sold by many sellers. I bought this one: https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B08216TP3D
